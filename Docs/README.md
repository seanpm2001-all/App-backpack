Documentation is incomplete. For now, the documentation will be contained in this 1 file. As such, these links don't work yet.

## The file format

App backpacks are an XML file using version 1.0 (fifth edition) of the XML standard. The default file format is `.backpack`

## Development

Backpack is currently very early in development. I wrote the first sample today, just to get the concept down.

## Backups

It is recommended to backup your computers app data at startup and before shutdown. To remain non-intrusive, backups won't be done without your permission, and it will always ask, and you will always have the option to opt out. It is highly recommended to do it when you can, from personal experience.

This project was inspired by a hardware failure on my laptop, where the operating system was unmounted after a keyboard replacement. It took over a month, but I got back onto it, with the majority of my data, although none of my app data, I had to restart on that.

The reason I recommend backing up before shutdown is because the night of the backup, I considered a backup to take too much time and not be necessary. Unfortunately, even small changes to a device can end horribly. I lost most of my app data, and had to restart with it. Since the backups for app-backpack are small, I recommend doing it before shutdown, so in case a repair is needed, there is a much higher chance at recovering app data.

It is currently estimated that a default Ubuntu installation backup file will be between 16 and 64 megabytes.
